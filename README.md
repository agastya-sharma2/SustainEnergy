# SustainEnergy

## Inspiration
Energy was something that is everywhere so it makes sense to sustain it.

## What it does
Informs you about eco-friendly options to make energy and best practices for sustaining energy at home.

## How we built it
We used Streamlit to create the website.

## Challenges we ran into
Coordination. Also since one of our teammates left midway, we were down to 2 people.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We pulled through and made a decent website. The website itself looks good and the data is also accurate.

## What we learned
How to stay up without falling asleep. We also learned how to use Streamlit which was new to some of us.

## What's next for #SustainEnergy
Definitely more data and ways to sustain energy. Maybe even move to educating about other different types of sustainability.
